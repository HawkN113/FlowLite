# FlowLite.Abstractions

**FlowLite** is a high-performance, thread-safe, and developer-friendly finite state machine (FSM) library for .NET.
This package contains **interfaces and abstractions** used across other FlowLite components. It allows you to define and work with state machines in a decoupled and extensible manner.
